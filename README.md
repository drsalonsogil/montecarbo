# montecarbo
MonteCarbo is a software to construct simple 5-, 6- and 7-membered ring multifunctionalized monosaccharides and nucleobases and to dock them into target glyco- and RNA/DNA- active enzymes. The core code is a bash script and it executes simple orders to generate the Z-matrix of the neutral molecule of interest. After that, a Fortran90 code based on a pseudo-random number generator (MonteCarlo method) is executed to asign dihedral angles to the different rotamers present in the structure (5-, 6-, 7-membered ring conformers and OH, NH2, CH2OH and so on). In order to transform the Z-matrix into a PDB or XYZ file, the program requires the installation of an external code (Babel, for example, default). The program also have a GIC implementation of the Cremer and Pople puckering coordinates for 5-, 6- and 7-membered ring ready to use in Gaussian16. Once the structures are generated and optimized using the preferred Quantum Mechanics software for the user, a second code is ready to execute AutoDock Vina in order to dock the different conformers of the molecule of interest in the active site of a wide family of enzymes.
